# TAGCAR

TAGCAR is a racing game of tag where you go around in a circle, usually left but not required. Yeehaw!

Collide with another car with a flag or bomb and the flag or bomb will be transferred to your car. Complete a lap by touching every track checkpoint. Complete a lap with the flag and gain a point! Complete a lap with the bomb and you lose.

A resurfacer will also drive around and randomly update obstacles along the checkpoints as it moves.

Try to make it to 10 points first!
